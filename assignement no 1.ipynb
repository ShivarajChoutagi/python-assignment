The integer, float, and complex values belong to a Python Numbers data-type. \\n\\nA.Int - Integer value can be any length such as integers 10, 2, 29, -20, -150 etc. Python has no restriction on the length of an integer. Its value belongs to int\\nB.Float - Float is used to store floating-point numbers like 1.9, 9.902, 15.2, etc. It is accurate upto 15 decimal points.\\nC.complex - A complex number contains an ordered pair, i.e., x + iy where x and y denote the real and imaginary parts, respectively. The complex numbers like 2.14j, 2.0 + 2.3j, etc.\\n\\n\\n2.Sequence Type\\nA.Strings\\nThe string can be defined as the sequence of characters represented in the quotation marks. In Python, we can use single, double, or triple quotes to define a string.\\nIn the case of string handling, the operator + is used to concatenate two strings as the operation \"hello\"+\" python\" returns \"hello python\".\\n\\nB.List\\nPython Lists are similar to arrays in C. However, the list can contain data of different types. The items stored in the list are separated with a comma (,) and enclosed within square brackets [].\\nWe can use slice [:] operators to access the data of the list. The concatenation operator (+) and repetition operator (*) works with the list in the same way as they were working with the strings.\\n\\nC.Tuple\\nA tuple is similar to the list in many ways. Like lists, tuples also contain the collection of the items of different data types. The items of the tuple are separated with a comma (,) and enclosed in parentheses ().\\nA tuple is a read-only data structure as we can\\'t modify the size and value of the items of a tuple.\\n\\nD.Dictionary\\nDictionary is an unordered set of a key-value pair of items. It is like an associative array or a hash table where each key stores a specific value. Key can hold any primitive data type, whereas value is an arbitrary Python object.\\nThe items in the dictionary are separated with the comma (,) and enclosed in the curly braces {}.\\n\\nE.Boolean\\nBoolean type provides two built-in values, True and False. These values are used to determine the given statement true or false. It denotes by the class bool. True can be represented by any non-zero value or \\'T\\' whereas false can be represented by the 0 or \\'F\\'. Consider the following example.\\n\\nF.Set\\nPython Set is the unordered collection of the data type. It is iterable, mutable(can modify after creation), and has unique elements. In set, the order of the elements is undefined; it may return the changed sequence of the element. The set is created by using a built-in function set(), or a sequence of elements is passed in the curly braces and separated by the comma. It can contain various types of values.
